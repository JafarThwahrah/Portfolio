# Portfolio

Dears,

This Repository Contains my Portfolio, Which is created to Represent my experiance and skills in programming, Also as a job seeker, I built it to introduce myself to the employers and customers as a referance for my work, its also contains my most recent projects, and some projects I have worked previously.


I used HTML, CSS with minimum Bootstrap for this project, I emphasized more on The CSS and tried to use as much advanced featuers as I can.

The Portfolio contains 2 pages, The first one includes introduction about me, my most recent projects, My previous projects, besides my Contact informations.
The second page contains more information about me including my personal photo, my current position, discription for my current position, besides my interests, skills and previous experiance, You can also download my resume from the download button located underneath my experiance section.

Thanks for interest,I hope you have a good navigation experiance.
